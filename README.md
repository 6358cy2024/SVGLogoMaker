# SVGLogoMaker

The purpose of this project is to create a node js program that is capable of creating svg logos on the browser.

This takes inputs on the terminal that is then sent into another js file to fill criteria with the answers given by the user.
Then it is sent back to the index.js file to write it into the logo.svg/html file for displaying. 

Npm inquirer, and jest are used in this project to take the user responses and to test the file properly.
This is not a deployed assignment, it is solely meant to be terminal based.

I will have a video that demonstrates how the program operates and the result that you get from running it properly.
